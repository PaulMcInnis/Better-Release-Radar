# Improved-Release-Radar
This is a script which uses Spotipy API calls to show you new albums by all the artists you follow on Spotify, by date.

What is the point of following artists on Spotify if it doesn't tell you when they release a new album every time? Why is there no way to see all the most recent albums in one place?

This is an improvement on Spotify's own Release Radar which is a truncated playlist and which makes it easy to miss new releases by artists you follow.
